I hope I was able to cover the topics, there are many topics, but I will mention briefly and beautifully about reading, I hope you like it.

The first thing about

"HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout"

What HTML; it's a hypertext markup language

Links are created using the <a> an element so it allows us to move from one page to another (connect).

## Directory: we can call it Folders on a website referred to as directories. 

Relative URLs: or Relative Link Types;

first Grandchild Folder:
Use the name of the child folder, followed by a forward slash

Child Folder:
child folder, use the name of the child folder, followed by a forward slash, then the file name

Same Folder:
in this we link a file in the same folder, just use the file name.

Page Sizes:
it's sizes and display resolutions of a page;

---

There are different position values:
First static: positioned according to the normal flow of the page
Third fixed: we can say that its  is positioned relative to the viewport
Second relative: position relative to its normal position.
Forth absolute:  is just taken out of the box of normal flow

Screen Resolution:
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch because it's related to a doted, called dots peace inside display

---

Functions in JS

we use the function to store the value for another code and to give it tasks to do to reduce code.

-function funcName(parm1,parm2){ code block; }

we can use with function (return);

to return the last value.

Layout

we can say it's like a style of HTML code it's (the main thing ) She owns the language codes like

<HTML>  / <header> / <section> / <article>
