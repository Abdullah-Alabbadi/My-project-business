# Forms, Lists, and Tables

In this reading, we want to talk about:

_Forms:_ it's like a space for visitors, also its element requires an action attribute to fill.

_Lists:_ The list-style-type property allows us to control the shape or style of a bullet point.

_Tables:_ For the table, it's the gaps between cells are removed using the border-spacing property. Font size is set for the and elements as they do not inherit their size from parent elements.

---

let's give an Example about what I mention:

_Forms:_

`<form action="https://canvas.instructure.com">`

`<p>username:`

`<input type="text" name="username" size ="12" maxlength="30"/>`

`</p>`

`</form>`

_Lists:_

## Format: ![Alt Text](/image/list.png)

_Tables:_

## Format: ![Alt Text](/image/table.png)

_In the end, I hope you enjoying reading, best wishes._
