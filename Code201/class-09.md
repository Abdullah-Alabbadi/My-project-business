# Forms, Lists, and Tables

In this reading, we want to talk about:

_Forms:_ it's like a space for visitors, also its element requires an action attribute to fill.

_Lists:_ The list-style-type property allows us to control the shape or style of a bullet point.

_Tables:_ For the table, it's the gaps between cells are removed using the border-spacing property. Font size is set for the and elements as they do not inherit their size from parent elements.

---

let's give an Example about what I mention:

_Forms:_

`<form action="https://canvas.instructure.com">`

`<p>username:`

`<input type="text" name="username" size ="12" maxlength="30"/>`

`</p>`

`</form>`

_Lists:_

`<h1>the gamer first</h1>`

`<h2>the gamer strong</h2>`

`<ol>`
`<li>playing<li><li>win<li></ol>`

_Tables:_

`<table class="one">`
`<tr>`
`<td>1</td>`
`<td>2</td>`
`</table>`

_In the end, I hope you enjoying reading, best wishes._
