**What I want to explain in this section is the beginning section of this course**

**First:** HTML: are the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.

so if we want to Say why, we can define headers, paragraphs, links, images, and more, if we want to how that's happening by opening tag, closing tag, content and attributes.

**there is a lot of definition to talk about in HTML So I am going to talk about little of them;**

**class attribute:** specifies one or more class names for an element. The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet.

<br>

Block Elements: Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. ex
( <h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li> ).

<br>

**Inline Elements:** Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. ex
( <a>, <b>, <em>, and <img> ).

<br>

**The main structure of HTML:** we can write the most important of

<!DOCTYPE HTML>

<html>

<head>
<title>Title of the Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1> <!-- header 1 -->
<h6> <!-- to header 6 -->
<p> <!-- paragraph -->
<ul> <!-- unordered list --> 
<ol> <!-- ordered list -->
<img> <!-- image -->
<a> <!-- hyperlink -->
<!-- -->  <!-- comment -->
<div> <!-- allows you to group a set of elements together -->
<iframe> <!-- window you  can see another page -->
<script> <!-- javascript code -->
</body>
</html>

**Second:** Javascript, CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.

in javascript, we have something called script so we can say its a series of instruction that a computer can follow it to achieve a goal, such as

Object and properties -object:
-method: it's like a functioning asset if instruction inside it
Document object used to change the content in page
