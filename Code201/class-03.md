I hope I was able to cover the topics, there are many topics, but I will mention briefly and beautifully about reading, I hope you like it.

The first thing is to list;

There are three types of list:

1-Numbered list

2-Buller lists

3-Definition

(Numbered list) we can say it’s ordered list because its has an arrangement number, so it’s use just number, for example;

<ol>

<li>contact</li>

<li>About us</li>

</ol>

(Buller list) it’s Unordered list lists we can say it’s list that start with bullet point Unordered lists use bullets;

<ul>

<li>play</li>

<li>start</li>

<li>end </li>

</ul>

(Definition lists) we can talk about it to explain the word in a new line Definition lists are used to define terminology.

<dl>

<dt>our company </dt>

<dd>we establish it in 2008 and it was a long time<dd>

</dl>

Boxes

We can use Boxes in CSS to controlling the size of text like its border, margin and padding, also to displaying and hiding text

I want to mention an important thing in boxes in CSS

The first thing is to control the dimensions of your boxes by some feature in CSS like

Margin: 14px;

Padding 12px;

The second is to create a border in the text, We have Box dimensions like width and height that control the beginning of the text such as;

height: 300px;

width: 300px;

we can limit width and height also by typing

min-width: 450px;}

max-width: 650px;}

in-height: 10px;}

max-height: 30px;}

we can also add a scroll in your text to navigate it if you want it’s will appear to the user besides the text in a beautiful way, that’s happening by add

overflow: scroll;}

---

(be note that!)

all of these happen in the CSS file in mentioned classes )

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We talk before about (border, margin, padding)

There is something I want to explain more

Border: separates the edge of the box from another

border:30px;}

Margin: that makes the text away from if we want to add the margin, we need to write this code;

margin: 20px;}

Padding: it’s the spacing between the border and the text inside it, if we want to add padding, we need to write this code;

padding: 10px;}

---

Some featured I forget to mention for you it’s (border style) / (border width) / (border color)

There is a lot of style we can use in css for border such as

border-style: solid;

border-style: dotted;

border-style: dashed;

border-style: groove;

border-style: double;

border-style: outset;

---

if we want to colour the Border, we want to lest the border in specific colour we can do that by inserting this code;

order-color: #0088dd;}

the last thing it’s about how to Merge all of style, width and color in the one text by type this code

{ width: 250px;

border: 3px dotted #0088dd;}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

centre text

if we want to centre the text on our page we can do that if we want we need to write this simple code;

text-align: center;}



there is an IE6 box model, the purpose of using it, to control the border of the text in a separate way, I mean from up, down, right and left.

SWITCH STATEMENTS

A switch statement’s statement that starts from word (switch), Each case indicates a possible value and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.



switch( expression ) {

case value-1:

Block-1

Break;

Block-2;

Break;
