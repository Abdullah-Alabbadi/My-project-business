# CSS  layout

In this class we will talk about how to deal will style in HTML and CSS, also I explained a few earlier, and now I'm going to add more.

Before starting I recommend watching this link: Click here to see. [class 4](Code201/class-04.md).

**First**, we want to talk about the difference between Block-level elements and Inline elements;

Block-level elements such as:

`<li> ,<p>, <h1> and <ul>`

A block-level element always starts on a new line.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

A block-level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.

---

**Inline elements such as:**

`<img> <b> <i> <a>`

An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

---

**Fixed Layout ( position )**

The position of the property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute, or sticky).

A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.

There are five different position values:

`static,
relative,
fixed,
absolute,
sticky`

Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.

**Grids:**

The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

**In the end, I hope you enjoying reading, best wishes.**
