# Element & Chart.js

**Chart:** it is the way to describe something in a better way, so if we want to create a chart first we need to download the chart from here Chart.js

we can configure it by type code in HTML that new Chart.chartType so after that these value  ``<canvas>`` ``</canvas>``

and in we can use ``(width, height, and these styles margin , border, background)``

---

**Drawing Paths:** it's like A list of points, connected by segments of lines we can draw Paths by using these code: ``fill()`` , ``beginPath()``, ``closePath()`` , ``stroke()`` ,

---

**Drawing Rectangles:** we can draw rectangles by using these code:
``clearRect(x, y, width, height)`` for Clears the specified rectangular area.

``illRect(x, y, width, height)`` for Draws a filled rectangle.
``strokeRect(x, y, width, height)`` for Draws a rectangular outline

(note) the parameter looks like y and X
