I learned how to create my repository also that Markdown is a way to style text on the web by adding bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists a lot of more, that have a specific extension like .md or .markdown,and it have also a specific syntax like

Headers
# for h1

## for h2

###### for h3

Emphasis
It has special formatting in texts such as an If we place the text between * * or _ _, the text will be italic.

If we place the text in between **   ** or __    __, the text will be bold.

In Lists
Unordered
And in the unordered, the sign * must be used, also We must take two spaces down.

In Ordered
And in the unordered, the sign number must be used, also We must take two spaces down.

there is a lot of so like image and link also, Blockquotes.
