The first thing I was learned about color:

**The first** that’s called rgb values
Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.

**The second:** a sign that called hex codes
hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code.

**The third:** a sign that’s called color Names
colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.

**There is a different in use Color;**

**in rgb values** a color can also have saturation and brightness as well as hue also Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colors.

**in hex codes** Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors.

**In color name** For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.
