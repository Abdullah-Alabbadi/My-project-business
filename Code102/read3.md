What I learned and realized its importance is,

firstly, create Sitemap and wireframe creation because It helps give web designers a clear idea of the website’s information architecture and explains the relationships between the various pages and content elements.

At the design stage and during construction, we must put beautiful touches on what we have created, such as pictures or a calm and beautiful background, and it must be comfortable for the eye, So you can dazzle your visitor Also, in the design stage, we must take into account and pay attention to something that is the customer or the potential person in his visit to the site, in general, this perspective must gradually develop with the design and I must take into account in the future if you want to design a website, that one day it will It has an application on the phone, also And that there is a certified designed trademark for this site, and that there is a competition in the products of any kind At this initial stage, the designer needs to define the goal to design a website that is somewhat distinct from others in cooperation with the partner or the person who has a partnership with his presence, and it is very important to think very carefully about the reason for creating the site so that it does not become worthless, and I must ask myself whether it is commercial or advertising Should it be international or not, and in what language should it be available?

There are several codes that help us in designing HTML pages, such as <nav> or <article> <header> Which helps us to divide the pages and including adding browsing specific points, also adding an article.

so in the end, we should experiment with what we have created so that we can see what was produced, how the outputs became, and is everything ok
