What I realized and learned about the **JavaScript language**, and as a person who wants to pass the information on to a friend who has no experience, so there are many important things that I will mention some of them very briefly because I cannot list them all.

**First:** To write a script, you need to first think about your idea, goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed to achieve it.

JavaScript recognizes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values **true or false** and pages that introduce key pieces of JavaScript. 
you should know that HTML code is shown in blue, CSS code in pink, and 
JavaScript in green colour. 
So javascript allows us to make web page more interaction by accessing and modifying the content and also markup used on a web page while you showing it in the browser
**Second**: There is a feature in the presence of JavaScript 
It's called ACCESS CONTENT (MODIFY CONTENT ), You, can select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. an example for ACCESS CONTENT: Selecting  the text inside all of the <h1>, also we can change the size or position of an <img> element (IMG tag we use it to add a photo to code)
there is something that is called React to the event: You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. like, it could be run when:  A button is pressed or A link is clicked on.

**Third: PROGRAM RULES** some for program rules in JavaScript, we can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow, it allows it to access or change the content of a page. such As: 
A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image.

**Fourthly: Arrangement of the code** is not always important in terms of implementation because it is A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page. Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them.

There are rules for naming variables that we must always follow when giving a name to a variable:

1-The name must begin with the letter Like.
2-the dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_) It must not start with a number.
3-The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (\_)
we should not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
4-You cannot use keywords or reserved words.  Because Keywords are special words 
All variables are case sensitive.
5-Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores for Example; Fname: so If the variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word, For Example, firstName rather than firstnarne

**Fifth:** ARRAYS: is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
ٍsuch as an array can be suited to storing the individual items on a shopping list because it is a list of related items.

to create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable we can do that by using the var keyword followed by the name of the array.

VALU ES IN ARRAYS Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. there is an important thing the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

**Sixthly:** EXPRESSIONS there are two types of it;

**1-Expression** that just assign a value to a variable like; var color = 'beige';

**2-Expression** that use two or more values to return a single value like; var area = 3 \* 2;
