what I was learned about **logical operators**:

**The first:** that’s called is Equal to (==).

We used for when we want to compare two values, String or Booleans and num.

**The second:** a sign that called is not Equal to (!=)

We used for when we want also to compare two values, String or Booleans and num.

**The third:** a sign that’s called is Equal to (===)

We use when we want to compare two values to check that both the data type and values are the same

**The fourth:** a sign that’s called is Equal to (!==)  

We use when we want to compare two values  to check that both the data type and values are not the same

**The fifth:** a sign that’s called is greater than, less than to (>) or (<)

 We use it when we want to check that if the number on the left or the right is greater than that, less than the opposite number.

**The sixth:** a sign that’s called is greater than, less than or equal to (>=) or (<=)

We use it when we want to check that if the number on the left or the right is greater than, less than or equal to the opposite number.

 

**The seventh:** a sign that’s called is Logical Operators (&&)

We use it when we want to return single values of true or false that allow us to compare more than one results for example ((7<4)  && (6>=9))

**Eighth:** logical or

We use it when we want to test at least one condition for Example ((2<5) || (2<1))

**Ninth:** logical not

We use it when we want to take a single Boolean value and inverts it

**Tenth:** loops;

We can be called it that checks a condition, so if it returns true, what inside the code will run, and repeated the same operation until the condition be false

There are **three types of the loop*;** For, While, Do while

**For:** we used it to run a specific number of Repeat value
**While:** we used it when we don’t know how many time the code should run
**Do while:** we can say it’s the same While but has one key **difference** it will still run the condition
