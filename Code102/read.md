In the beginning, I do not think that there are any big differences in text editors, I think that the difference between them is only in the interface, each editor does the same work, after what I understood from the teacher and after looking forward from the Internet, I did not notice any difference, only an editor I liked to use I stayed on him.

As for the command line, which I understood, and to be able to use it, I must practice writing on it because at the beginning I will find it difficult to use it and I can write whatever I want on it in a specific format.

As for navigation, through which we can infer my current position at work. As for files, everything that exists and I deal with is considered a file and has a special extension, and it helps me in everything.
