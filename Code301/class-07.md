# Read: Class (07) REST

## there is some important question we should ask us about State and Props:

---
<br>

**1-Who is Roy Fielding?** He one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer (REST).

<br>

**2-Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?** "Because they weren't designed to be used like being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern."

<br>

**3-What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?** "is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page."

<br>

**4-What does a GET do?** In Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET.

<br>

**5-What does a POST do?** If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.
<br>

**6-What does PUT do?** What does PATCH do? "If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT or, to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH".

<br>

**7-Did you get your API key?** yes

<br>

_**In the end, I hope you enjoying reading, best wishes.**_
