**1- Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

| SQL                                    |                                             NoSQL |
|                                                                    |                                                                                                                                       |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                                                                    |                                                                                                                                       |
| called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)                             |                                                                                     called as non-relational or distributed database. |
|                                                                    |                                                                                                                                       |
| SQL databases have predefined schema                               |                                                                            NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data. |
|                                                                    |                                                                                                                                       |
| SQL databases are vertically scalable                              |                                                                                             NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable |
|                                                                    |                                                                                                                                       |
| SQL databases uses SQL for defining and manipulating the data      | In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). |
|                                                                    |                                                                                                                                       |
| SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. |                                                                            NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb |

**2-What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?** SQL databases are a good fit for the complex query

<br>

**3-Give a real-world example?** NoSQL databases :MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb

<br>

**4-What kind of data is a good fit for a NoSQL database?** On a high-level unstructured and unrelated data, uncomplex queries.

<br>

**5-Give a real-world example?** MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres, and MS-SQL.

<br>

**6-Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?** NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage database like MongoDB, and Redis

<br>

**7-Which type of database is best for scalability?** no SQL and SQL but, In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage the increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add a few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.

**1-What does SQL stand for?** Structured Query Language

<br>

**2-What is a relational database?** type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another

<br>

**3-What type of structure does a relational database work with?** SQL like MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres.

<br>

**4-What is a ‘schema’?** its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system.

<br>

**5-What is a NoSQL database, How does it work?** is a type of database that stores and retrieves data without needing to define its structure first and It's work in a perfect way and it is so speed also

<br>

**7-What is inside of a Mongo database?** it's without schema and without table it's called collections and inside collection we have document and all of them have differant field.

<br>

**8-Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why:** MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.

<br>

**9-What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

<br>

_1- NoSQL databases don’t have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have._

<br>

_2-developers will have to implement their own code, making their systems more complex._

<br>

_3-NoSQL are very new compared to SQL Databases._
